# Better Pawn Control Synchronizer

Automatically applies [Better Pawn Control (BPC)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541460369) policies across all supported tabs—**Work**, **Schedule**, **Assign**, **Animals**, **Weapons**, **Mechs**, and **Robots**—based on matching policy labels.

This mod enhances your RimWorld micromanagement experience by keeping your tabs in sync with the active BPC policy and clearly displaying it on the UI.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The mod inspects available BPC manager types (AssignManager, WorkManager, etc.).
- When a policy label is selected or changed, the mod finds the matching policy on each manager and applies it.
- It also patches RimWorld's tab label rendering to include the active policy name for better clarity.
