## 🔁 Better Pawn Control Synchronizer

This mod automatically applies Better Pawn Control (BPC) policies across all supported tabs based on matching policy labels—eliminating micromanagement and keeping your colony in sync.

### 🔹 Features

- Instantly syncs BPC policies when switching or loading maps  
- Adds a sync button to the in-game **Play Settings** menu  
- Displays the current BPC policy label directly in each main tab (Work, Schedule, Assign, etc.)  
- Omits label overlay when the active policy is “Default”  
- Fully supports **UI Not Included**, with automatic label positioning adjustments  
- Built with Harmony for robust mod compatibility

---

### ⚙️ In-Game Settings

Customize the appearance of policy indicators directly in the mod settings menu:

- Toggle whether labels are shown at all  
- Select to show the **first letter** of the policy name for non-default policies to keep labels compact
- Select label color when *UI Not Included* is active
- Adjust label X/Y positioning offsets for fine control when *UI Not Included* is active
