## 🔁 Better Pawn Control Synchronizer

This mod automatically applies Better Pawn Control (BPC) policies across all supported tabs based on matching policy labels—removing micromanagement and keeping your colony synced.

### 🔹 Features

- Adds a sync button to the in-game Play Settings menu
- Displays the active BPC policy label directly in each main tab (Work, Schedule, Assign, etc.)
- Skips label overlay for “Default” policies to avoid clutter
- Compatible with *UI Not Included*
- Built with Harmony patching for compatibility
